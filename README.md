## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app was developed to help users track their weight easily. It focuses on user needs like recording daily weights, setting and checking target goals, and providing notifications.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Key screens include a login page, a data grid for weight tracking, and options to update the target weight. The UI was designed to be clean and easy to understand, so users can navigate easily and focus on their goals. 

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I broke the development process into small, manageable steps, focusing on one functionality at a time. This allowed me to frequently test and made debugging easier.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tested the app while making it to catch any bugs early and make sure everything worked as intended. This was important to creating a nice, user-friendly app and revealed areas where I needed to fix both the UI and backend logic.

## Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One challenge was integrating notifications when users reached their target weight. I did this by learning how to implement Android notifications effectively, which added a motivating feature to the app.

## In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The data tracking functionality, including storing and displaying user-specific entries, was a strong demonstration of my skills in combining user centered design with backend development.
